# Frontend-lab2

## Description
This project showcases a styled HTML table and two different CSS-based target designs.

- *Table* displays user information with alternating row colors and dynamic hover effects that swap background and text colors for enhanced interactivity.
- *Target 1* created using CSS transforms and grid layout for centering and layering elements, including crosshairs.
- *Target 2* built using positioning to precisely place rings and crosshair elements inside a relatively positioned container.

This project highlights practical CSS techniques for layout, styling, and interactivity, emphasizing the difference between transform and position for element alignment and layering.
